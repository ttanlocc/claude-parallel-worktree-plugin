# Artifact Board Mirror Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Mirror the existing ledger and ADO data into an artifact `db`, and publish a board page that renders it live — with the current dashboard on :4400 left running and untouched.

**Architecture:** A pure Python module (`bin/board_state.py`) turns today's data sources into the four db collections defined by the spec. It touches no network and no session — every branch is unit-testable. A thin scheduled `claude --bg` session calls it and writes the result via the Artifact tool's `write_db`. The published page declares `capabilities: {db: {}}` and renders through `onSnapshot`, so it updates without republishing or polling.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12 stdlib only (no new dependencies); assert-based pytest in `bin/test_*.py`; the Artifact tool (`publish`, `write_db`) from a Claude session; artifact runtime contract 0.2.41 (`claude.use("db")`).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-session-messaging-design.md` (step 1 of five)

## Global Constraints

- **Nothing is removed in this step.** `dashboard.py`, `dashboard.html`, `manager_daemon.py` and both `.jsonl` ledgers keep working exactly as they do today. This step only adds.
- **Python stdlib only.** The repo has no third-party runtime dependencies; do not add any.
- **Tests are assert-based pytest** in `bin/test_*.py`, run with `python3 -m pytest bin/ -q` from the repo root. 239 pass today; every task must leave the suite green.
- **No network or subprocess in unit tests.** Existing tests fake `subprocess.run` and inject readers; follow that pattern.
- **Collection and field names come from the spec verbatim** — `sessions/<task-name>`, `escalations/<id>`, `tickets/<ado-id>`, `meta/status`. Do not rename.
- **`state` vocabulary for sessions:** `running` · `idle` · `waiting` · `done`. `waiting` means blocked on a permission prompt and is the state the current dashboard cannot express.
- **Escalation `kind`** is normalised with the existing `escalations.normalize_kind()`; the raw value is preserved alongside it as `kind_raw`.
- **Commit after every task.** One `<type>: <description>` subject line, no body unless the WHY is non-obvious.

### Task 1: Session documents from the agents listing

**Files:**
- Create: `bin/board_state.py`
- Test: `bin/test_board_state.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing (first task)
- Produces: `session_docs(agents: list[dict], registry: dict) -> dict[str, dict]` — maps task name to a document body. `agents` is `claude agents --json --all` output; `registry` is the parsed `.parallel-registry.json`.

### Task 6: A CLI that prints the write set

**Files:**
- Modify: `bin/board_state.py`
- Test: `bin/test_board_state.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `build_writes` from Task 5.
- Produces: `python3 bin/board_state.py` printing the write set as JSON on stdout. This is the seam the scheduled session calls — it reads the real files and shells out to `az`/`claude agents`, so it lives behind `main()` and is never exercised by a unit test.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_collect_uses_injected_readers_and_never_touches_the_network():
    """The readers are injected so the collection step is testable without `az`, `gh` or a live
    session — the same shape `test_dashboard.py` already uses for `ask`."""
    from board_state import collect

    writes = collect(
        read_agents=lambda: [{"name": "t1", "sessionId": "s1", "state": "waiting"}],
        read_registry=lambda: {"t1": {"branch": "feature/x", "short_id": "ab12"}},
        read_escalations=lambda: [{"id": "e1", "kind": "credentials", "question": "?"}],
        read_tickets=lambda: [{"id": "1", "title": "t", "state": "New", "sprint": "S1", "url": "u"}],
        read_prs=lambda: {},
        now=lambda: 500.0,
    )

    sessions = [w for w in writes if w["collection"] == "sessions"]
    assert sessions[0]["data"]["state"] == "waiting"
    assert writes[-1]["data"]["written_at"] == 500.0


def test_collect_degrades_to_an_empty_source_when_one_reader_fails():
    """`az` not being authenticated must not blank the whole board — every other source is
    still worth publishing, and meta/status will show the ADO age going stale."""
    from board_state import collect

    def boom():
        raise OSError("az not logged in")

    writes = collect(
        read_agents=lambda: [{"name": "t1", "sessionId": "s1", "state": "idle"}],
        read_registry=lambda: {},
        read_escalations=lambda: [],
        read_tickets=boom,
        read_prs=lambda: {},
        now=lambda: 500.0,
    )

    assert [w for w in writes if w["collection"] == "sessions"]
    assert not [w for w in writes if w["collection"] == "tickets"]
    assert writes[-1]["data"]["last_ado_sweep"] is None
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `python3 -m pytest bin/test_board_state.py -q -k collect`
Expected: FAIL — `ImportError: cannot import name 'collect'`

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

Add to `bin/board_state.py`:

```python
import json
import subprocess
import sys

_SUBPROC_ERRORS = (OSError, subprocess.SubprocessError, json.JSONDecodeError)


def _safe(reader, fallback):
    """Read one source, or fall back. A source that cannot be read must not blank the board —
    every other source is still worth publishing, and meta/status shows the missing one aging."""
    try:
        return reader()
    except Exception:  # noqa: BLE001 — any reader failure degrades to "this source is absent"
        return fallback


def collect(read_agents, read_registry, read_escalations, read_tickets, read_prs, now) -> list[dict]:
    """Gather every source and return the write set. Readers are injected so this is testable
    without `az`, `gh`, or a live session."""
    tickets = _safe(read_tickets, None)
    stamp = now()
    return build_writes(
        agents=_safe(read_agents, []),
        registry=_safe(read_registry, {}),
        escalations=_safe(read_escalations, []),
        tickets=tickets or [],
        pr_by_ticket=_safe(read_prs, {}),
        now=stamp,
        # None, not `stamp`: a sweep that failed must not claim to have just run.
        ado_swept_at=stamp if tickets is not None else None,
    )


def main() -> int:
    """Print the write set as JSON. The scheduled session pipes this into `write_db`."""
    import time

    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    import dashboard
    import manager_daemon

    def read_registry():
        # The registry FILE is already keyed by task name, which is the shape session_docs
        # wants. `dashboard.get_registry()` shells out to parallel-task.sh and returns a list;
        # reading the file skips a subprocess and a reshape.
        path = os.path.join(dashboard.REPO_DIR, ".claude", "worktrees", ".parallel-registry.json")
        with open(path, encoding="utf-8") as f:
            return json.load(f)

    writes = collect(
        # list_agents lives in manager_daemon, not dashboard.
        read_agents=manager_daemon.list_agents,
        read_registry=read_registry,
        read_escalations=lambda: dashboard.get_escalations()["needs_human"],
        # No `or None`: an empty backlog is a successful sweep that found nothing, and must
        # stamp last_ado_sweep. Only an exception (caught by _safe) means "did not run".
        read_tickets=dashboard.get_ado_backlog,
        read_prs=lambda: {},
        now=time.time,
    )
    json.dump(writes, sys.stdout, ensure_ascii=False)
    return 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(main())
```

Add `import os` to the imports at the top of the file.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `python3 -m pytest bin/ -q`
Expected: PASS — 261

Then confirm the CLI runs against real data:

Run: `cd /home/azureuser/projects/claude-parallel-worktree-plugin && python3 bin/board_state.py | python3 -c "import sys,json; w=json.load(sys.stdin); print(len(w),'writes'); print(sorted({x['collection'] for x in w}))"`
Expected: a non-zero count and the four collection names.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add bin/board_state.py bin/test_board_state.py
git commit -m "feat: board_state CLI emitting the write set as JSON"
```

### Task 7: The board page

**Files:**
- Create: `bin/board.html`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the four collections written by Task 5, read live via `claude.use("db")`.
- Produces: a page published once with `capabilities: {db: {}}`; nothing else reads it.

There is no unit test for this task — it is a browser page against a live store. Its check is Task 8's manual verification.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the page**

Create `bin/board.html`. Requirements, each of which Task 8 verifies:

- Declares nothing itself; capabilities are passed at publish time.
- `const db = await claude.use("db")` — **branch on `null`** and render an explicit "cannot reach data" panel. Never a blank board.
- Four subscriptions via `onSnapshot`, one per collection: `sessions`, `escalations`, `tickets`, and the single doc `meta/status`.
- Renders at rest: before any snapshot arrives, show a "connecting" state, not an empty page.
- **Escalations first**, sorted P0 → P1 → P2, each showing `severity`, `kind` (with a ⚠ when `kind !== kind_raw`), `question`, waiting time from `ts`, and one button per entry in `options`.
- **Sessions** next, with `waiting` visually distinct from `running` — that state is the whole reason this collection exists.
- **Tickets** last, filterable by `sprint` and `state`, sorted by ticket number, with done work collapsed.
- A freshness line per source from `meta/status`: "ADO as of N minutes ago", "sessions as of N seconds ago". When an age exceeds 3× its expected cadence, mark it — a growing age is the failure signal.
- Clicking an option writes `db.doc("escalations/<id>").update({answer, answered_at, status: "answered"})`. The manager picks it up later; the page must say so ("sent — the manager will act on this shortly") rather than implying it took effect.
- Theme-aware per the artifact design rules; no external scripts.

The db wiring is the part with a real contract and must not be guessed — use exactly this
skeleton (runtime contract 0.2.41; `DocumentSnapshot` is `{id, exists, data()}`, `QuerySnapshot`
is `{docs, size, empty}`):

```html
<script>
const view = { sessions: [], escalations: [], tickets: [], meta: null, db: null };

function render() { /* draw from `view`; called after every snapshot */ }

(async () => {
  render();                                   // at rest, before any data
  const db = await claude.use("db");          // null: not served, not granted, or failed
  if (!db) {
    document.getElementById("board").replaceChildren(
      Object.assign(document.createElement("div"), {
        className: "unavailable",
        textContent: "Không đọc được dữ liệu bảng.",
      }));
    return;                                   // never leave the page blank
  }
  view.db = db;

  const onErr = (where) => (e) => {
    // A terminal snapshot error kills that listener; say which source went dark rather than
    // letting its section quietly freeze at its last value.
    console.error(where, e);
    view[where] = [];
    render();
  };

  db.collection("sessions").onSnapshot(
    (snap) => { view.sessions = snap.docs.map(d => ({ id: d.id, ...d.data() })); render(); },
    onErr("sessions"));
  db.collection("escalations").onSnapshot(
    (snap) => { view.escalations = snap.docs.map(d => ({ id: d.id, ...d.data() })); render(); },
    onErr("escalations"));
  db.collection("tickets").onSnapshot(
    (snap) => { view.tickets = snap.docs.map(d => ({ id: d.id, ...d.data() })); render(); },
    onErr("tickets"));
  db.doc("meta/status").onSnapshot(
    (snap) => { view.meta = snap.exists ? snap.data() : null; render(); },
    onErr("meta"));
})();

async function answerEscalation(id, option) {
  if (!view.db) return;
  await view.db.doc(`escalations/${id}`).update({
    answer: option,
    answered_at: Date.now() / 1000,
    status: "answered",
  });
  // The manager is asleep and a db write is not a wake — say what actually happens next.
  toast("Đã gửi — manager sẽ xử lý trong vài phút.");
}
</script>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
git add bin/board.html
git commit -m "feat: artifact board page reading the db live"
```

---

### Task 8: Publish once and verify against real data

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-07-artifact-board-mirror.md` (record the URL)

This task is manual: it publishes a real artifact and writes real rows.

- [ ] **Step 1: Seed the store from the real sources**

```bash
cd /home/azureuser/projects/claude-parallel-worktree-plugin
python3 bin/board_state.py > /tmp/board-writes.json
python3 -c "import json;w=json.load(open('/tmp/board-writes.json'));print(len(w),'writes')"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Publish the page**

Publish `bin/board.html` with the Artifact tool, passing `capabilities: {db: {}}`, a title, a description and a favicon. Record the URL in this plan file.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the seeded rows**

Use the Artifact tool's `write_db` with `db_op: "batch"`, passing the entries from `/tmp/board-writes.json` (at most 50 per batch — split if the file is longer).

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify in the browser**

Open the URL and confirm, against what `dashboard.py` on :4400 shows at the same moment:
- the same open escalations, with the same severities;
- the same worker tasks and states, including any `waiting`;
- the same ticket counts per sprint;
- freshness lines showing plausible ages.

Any disagreement is a bug in `board_state.py`, not in the page — fix it there, with a test, and re-run the batch.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify live update without republishing**

With the page open, run `python3 bin/board_state.py` again and write one changed document via `write_db`. The open page must update **without a reload and without a republish**. If it does not, `onSnapshot` is not wired correctly.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit the recorded URL**

```bash
git add docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-07-artifact-board-mirror.md
git commit -m "docs: record the published board artifact URL"
```

---

### Task 9: Schedule the mirror

**Files:**
- Create: `bin/board-mirror.md` (the prompt the scheduled session runs)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `python3 bin/board_state.py` from Task 6; the artifact URL from Task 8.
- Produces: a repeatable refresh, run by a scheduled `claude --bg` session.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the session prompt**

Create `bin/board-mirror.md`:

```markdown
Refresh the manager board. Do exactly this and nothing else.

1. Run: `python3 <plugin bin dir>/board_state.py`
   It prints a JSON array of write entries on stdout.
2. Write those entries to the artifact at <URL recorded in the plan> using the Artifact
   tool's `write_db` with `db_op: "batch"`. Batches take at most 50 entries — split if needed.
3. Report one line: how many documents were written, and the value of `last_ado_sweep`.

Do not publish the page. Do not edit any file. If step 1 fails, report the error and stop —
a failed refresh must leave the previous rows standing rather than write partial state.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it once by hand**

```bash
cd /home/azureuser/projects/claude-parallel-worktree-plugin
claude --bg -n board-mirror -- "$(cat bin/board-mirror.md)"
```

Wait for it to finish (`claude agents --json --all`), then confirm the page updated.

- [ ] **Step 3: Schedule it**

Create a cron entry that runs the same prompt every 15 minutes, using `CronCreate` from a session. Record the cron id in `bin/board-mirror.md` as a comment so it can be found and removed later.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify two consecutive runs**

Wait for two scheduled runs. Confirm `meta/status.last_ado_sweep` advances each time and the page reflects it without a republish.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add bin/board-mirror.md
git commit -m "feat: scheduled prompt refreshing the board artifact"
```

---

## Done when

- `python3 -m pytest bin/ -q` passes, 261 tests.
- The artifact URL shows the same escalations, sessions and tickets as `:4400` does at the same moment.
- An open page updates from a `write_db` without a republish.
- Two consecutive scheduled runs have advanced `meta/status`.
- `dashboard.py`, `manager_daemon.py` and both ledgers are byte-identical to their state before this plan started.

## Out of scope for this step

Everything that removes something. The manager stays a `-p --resume` subprocess (spec step 3), the
dashboard keeps serving :4400 (step 4), and the ledgers keep being written (step 5). Workers do not
write db here — that is step 2, and the mirror reads the ledger on their behalf until then.
