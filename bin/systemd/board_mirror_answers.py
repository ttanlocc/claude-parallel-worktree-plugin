"""Bring an escalation answer recorded on the published board back down into the manager's ledger.

Everything else the pump does travels one way: board_state.py reads this plugin's data and the
scheduled session pushes it into the artifact db. An answer clicked on the board goes the other
way — board.html writes the chosen option to the artifact's own `escalation_answers` collection,
the same session reads that collection back on its next run, and this module decides what of it
may be appended to the escalation ledger.

Deliberately a SEPARATE collection from `escalations`: that one is board_state.py's write set, so
anything the page wrote there would be overwritten by the next mirror run — or, once the document
dropped out of board_state.py's output, turned into a `delete` by board_mirror_diff.py.

Two rules do all the work, and both are decided against the LEDGER, never against the payload:

  never clobber   an answer is appended only when the ledger's newest record for that id is
                  `needs_human` and carries no answer yet. Already answered (on port 4400, or by
                  the manager), dismissed, still `open` and untriaged by the daemon, or
                  needs_human carrying an undeliverable answer someone may already have acted on
                  — every one of those is left exactly as it is, and the incoming answer is
                  dropped with a line on stderr rather than layered on top.

  idempotent      falls out of that same rule. The answer is never deleted from the artifact db,
                  so every later pump run reads it again; the first append flips the ledger to
                  `answered`, which fails the rule above from then on. No dedupe file, no
                  delete-after-apply, nothing that can drift out of sync with the ledger.

The payload is untrusted — written by a sandboxed page, read back through a model — so it is
treated as data throughout. The only string ever appended is one the LEDGER itself lists among
that record's options: matched against the ledger's copy, then taken from it. Nothing arbitrary
out of shared storage can reach the manager through this path.
