"""Cut board_state.py's full write set down to what actually changed since the last successful
run, turn documents that disappeared into `delete` ops, and split the result into batches the
artifact's write_db actually accepts.

Pure transforms only, like board_state.py itself — no I/O in diff_writes()/chunk_writes()/
apply_batch(), so this is testable without a real snapshot file. main() below is the only I/O,
called by run-board-mirror.sh once per run for "diff" and "chunk", then once per batch for
"apply".

The snapshot is a CHECKPOINT, not an end-of-run report. It used to be written exactly once, after
the whole write finished, which meant a run killed at TimeoutStartSec mid-write recorded nothing:
259 live documents against a 120-document snapshot produced a 156-document diff that took ~310s
against a 240s budget, so every run wrote ~120 documents, died, recorded none of them, and the
next run recomputed the identical diff and died identically. The pump could not recover on its
own. "apply" replaces that: run-board-mirror.sh folds each batch in only after that batch's own
claude -p reported it landed, so an interrupted run keeps what it actually wrote and the next run
only does the remainder.

Direction matters and is asymmetric. Re-writing a document that was already written is harmless
(write_db set is idempotent); recording one that was NOT written is unrecoverable — the next diff
calls it unchanged and skips it forever, leaving a silently wrong board with no error anywhere.
So the record always happens AFTER the write, never before: a crash in between costs one rewrite.
