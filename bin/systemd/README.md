# board-mirror systemd user timer

Runs the refresh described in `bin/board-mirror.md` every 5 minutes, independent of any Claude
session — replaces the session-scoped `CronCreate` job that died when its session exited (see
board-mirror.md's Scheduling section for what that cost).

## 0. Prerequisite — enable linger (needs a higher-privileged account, MANDATORY)

```
loginctl enable-linger azureuser
```

This needs root or sudo — a normal user cannot enable-linger for themselves. **Do not skip this
step or treat it as optional.** Without it, `systemctl --user` services are tied to a logind
session: they stop the moment the last login session for this user ends (SSH disconnect,
terminal closed), which is exactly the failure this timer exists to fix, just delayed until
logout instead of session exit. Confirm it took effect:

```
loginctl show-user azureuser -p Linger
```

Expect `Linger=yes`. If you cannot run `loginctl enable-linger` yourself, ask whoever has root on
this box to run it, and don't consider this setup done until `Linger=yes` comes back — a timer
installed without it will look correct today and die at the next logout.

## 1. Config file (outside the repo, real values only here)

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/board-mirror
cp bin/systemd/board-mirror.env.example ~/.config/board-mirror/env
chmod 600 ~/.config/board-mirror/env
$EDITOR ~/.config/board-mirror/env   # fill in ARTIFACT_URL and PWT_REPO_ROOT for real
```

If you hold more than one ADO identity, also set `PWR_ADO_ASSIGNED_TO` in that file to a
comma-separated list of all of them. Left unset, the WIQL query falls back to `@Me`, which
matches only the identity `az` is currently logged in as — tickets under any other identity
of the same person go missing from the board with no error.

## 2. Symlink the run script and unit files

```
ln -sf "$(pwd)/bin/systemd/run-board-mirror.sh" ~/.config/board-mirror/run-board-mirror.sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
ln -sf "$(pwd)/bin/systemd/board-mirror.service" ~/.config/systemd/user/board-mirror.service
ln -sf "$(pwd)/bin/systemd/board-mirror.timer" ~/.config/systemd/user/board-mirror.timer
```

Symlinks, not copies: re-running these two commands after a `git pull` is the entire upgrade
path, no reinstall step needed.

## 3. Enable and start

```
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now board-mirror.timer
```

## 4. Verify

```
systemctl --user list-timers board-mirror.timer
systemctl --user status board-mirror.service
journalctl --user -u board-mirror.service -n 50
```

A healthy `list-timers` row shows a `NEXT` a few minutes out and a `LAST`/`PASSED` from the run
before it. `status` on the service after a run shows `Active: inactive (dead)` with
`Main PID: ... (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)` — `oneshot` units go back to inactive between
runs, that's expected, not a failure. A failed refresh (bad env, `board_state.py` erroring inside
the session, a malformed `claude -p` reply) shows as `status=1/FAILURE` here and the reason in the
journal line above it — see `run-board-mirror.sh` for what each exit path logs.

To force one run without waiting for the timer: `systemctl --user start board-mirror.service`.
