# dev-native.sh — run gateway + frontend NATIVELY (no Docker) per git worktree,
# for fast parallel-task iteration. Complements dev-stack.sh (Docker slots),
# which stays the right tool for prod-topology / pre-merge verification.
#
# Why this exists: a Docker slot bakes production builds into images — every
# code change needs a rebuild (~seconds to a minute) before you see it. This
# runs `uvicorn --reload` + `vite` dev server directly on the host: sub-second
# hot-reload on both sides, and much lighter (~2 native processes vs. 4
# containers per task). Benchmarked on this VM: Docker slot up ~49s cache-warm
# + full rebuild per change; native infra+app up ~20s total + <1s per change.
#
# Design: ONE shared Postgres/Azurite (the `infra` subcommand) for every task
# — only the gateway/frontend are per-task. Each task gets its own DB name,
# own ports, own WORKSPACE_ROOT, so tasks can't see each other's data or
# agent-run files even though they share one Postgres server.
#
# Usage:
#   dev-native.sh infra <up|down|status>
#   dev-native.sh <task> <up|down|status|logs [gateway|frontend]|migrate>
#
#   task | gateway | frontend | postgres db
#   -----+---------+----------+------------------
#    1   |  8501   |  5501    |  aiquinta_native_t1
#    2   |  8502   |  5502    |  aiquinta_native_t2
#
# Shared infra ports (fixed, distinct from both the classic `deploy` stack
# and dev-stack.sh's slots so all three can coexist): postgres 5599, azurite
# 10099, project name `aiquinta-native-infra`.
#
# Two gaps this script papers over that Docker's compose file hides behind
# implicit defaults — see README "Parallel dev stacks" for the fuller story:
#   - ENVIRONMENT=development: the gateway refuses to start with
#     LANGSMITH_TRACING=true unless this is set; Docker's compose file
#     defaults it even when .env doesn't. Native has no such fallback.
#   - BUILTIN_PLUGIN_*_DIR: Docker COPYs agents/plugins/* to /mnt/plugins/*
#     in the image. Native has no image, so these must point at this
#     worktree's own agents/plugins/ or built-in skills silently vanish.

  # NOT `uvicorn --reload`: the gateway installs its own SIGTERM handler
  # (main.py `_install_drain_handler`, for graceful production draining —
  # rejects new runs, lets in-flight ones finish) that never itself exits
  # the process. uvicorn's --reload sends SIGTERM and just waits for the
  # worker to die on its own; with this app it never does, so reload hangs
  # forever — confirmed by testing (>30s, indefinitely stuck on "draining",
  # old code still serving the whole time since /health responds 200
  # regardless of drain state, which is what made this look like a fast
  # reload in an earlier, insufficiently-verified pass). `watchfiles` sends
  # SIGINT first (not intercepted by the app — only SIGTERM is), which
  # triggers normal asyncio/uvicorn shutdown; --sigkill-timeout is a safety
  # net in case that ever doesn't work either. Confirmed working: a full
  # restart takes ~13s (fresh Python process + reimports), not sub-second —
  # slower than in-process reload would be, but it's a real code change
  # taking effect, not a stuck worker serving stale code.

  #    `--port ${GATEWAY_PORT}`, so pkill -f can target it precisely enough
  #    to not touch a *different* task's supervisor.
  # 2. The actual bound worker still needs a port-based kill regardless of
  #    which supervisor spawned it: uvicorn's own --reload (not used here
  #    anymore, but the next person reading this may reintroduce it) spawns
  #    its worker via Python multiprocessing.spawn, which re-execs with a
  #    generic `python -c spawn_main(...)` argv carrying no trace of --port,
  #    AND reparents to PID 1 — invisible to any PID captured at launch and
